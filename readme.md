<h1>NBA Statistical Analysis</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>At this point, there is no purpose. I just need to brush up on my SQL skills and an NBA project sounded like a fun way to motivate myself. At this time the data is composed of box scores from 1945 to April 6, 2022.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>

1. Expand datasets to include team and league wide statistics.
2. Implement player growth visualization.
3. Discover insights that I find interesting.

<h2>Updates</h2>
<h3>July 10, 2023:</h3>
<h>Project inception. Currently only features database setup using the box score dataset (1945 - 2023).</h>
